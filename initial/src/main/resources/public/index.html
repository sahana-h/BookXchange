<h1 class="center">Our Mission</h1>
<p class="center">Education is a right for students across the globe, yet many students struggle to find the resources and funds to get the tools they need to suceed academically. It is both expensive and difficult to find textbooks at an affordable price, which acts as an obstacle towards the learning process. On top of this, the one-use of textbooks leads to unnecessary amounts of wasted paper, labor, and fuel. BookXChange aims to combat both expensive costs of education and production waste by allowing students to exchange books with each other. 
</p>
<h1 class="center">How to use BookXChange</h1>
<p class = "center">For first time users, you will have to enter an email address you are okay with being contacted with and your zip code so that we can find buyers/sellers near you. You will then be given a user ID that you can use to login to your profile. At your profile, you will be able to add the books you are looking for and the books you are looking to sell. On the matches page, you can see people who are willing to buy/sell the books you have listed on your profile and you will be emailed if a match occurs. From here, you can see on their profile the email they would like to be contacted through and you can reach out to them to set up the meeting time and location. Happy exchanging!
