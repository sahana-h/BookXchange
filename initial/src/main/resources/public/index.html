<h1 class="center">Our Mission</h1>
<p class="center">Education is a right for students across the globe, yet many students struggle with obtaining resources they need to suceed academically, with 65% of college students unable to afford textbooks, according to a national study. Books and textbooks are expensive, heavy, and usually for short-term usage. This leads to unnecessary amounts of wasted paper, shipment emissions, and not to mention, unwanted junk. BookXChange aims to combat issues of skyrocketing education costs and consumerism by allowing the peer-to-peer buying and selling of books on a local and affordable scale.
</p>
<h1 class="center">How to use BookXChange</h1>
<p class = "center">For first time users,  enter an email address you consent to being contacted with, as well as your zip code, in order to locate buyers/sellers in or near your area. You will then be given a user ID that you can use to login to your profile. At your profile, you will be able to add the books you are looking for and the books you are looking to sell. On the matches page, you can see people who are willing to buy/sell the books you have listed on your profile and you will be emailed if a match occurs. From here, you can see on their profile the email they would like to be contacted through and you can reach out to them to set up the meeting time and location. Happy exchanging!
